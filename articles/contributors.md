## Ideas and projects

If you don't know where to get started, here is a list of topics where I would
really use some help !

* New strategies for [Insights](https://github.com/intuition-io/insights)
* Beta-testers for the web dashboard ([Signup here !](http://intuition.io))
* Data sources, especially Bitcoin, options, futures, ...
* More markets supported
* [Live report generation](https://github.com/intuition-io/insights/blob/develop/insights/plugins/mail.py)
* Database. Current [Rethinkdb](rethinkdb.com) implementation makes thing
really easy to play with, but one instance is really slow.


## Style guide

* TODO: Pep8 and flakes
* TODO: Git flow
* TODO: Tests and coverage


## Versioning Semantics

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to
maintain backward compatibility, Ghost will be maintained according to the
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>`

Constructed with the following guidelines:

* A new *major* release indicates a large change where backwards compatibility is broken.
* A new *minor* release indicates a normal change that maintains backwards compatibility.
* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.


## Commit messages convention

From now on git commit messages will follow this [Angular wise document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#).
To sum up :

```
{{ type }} ({{ scope }}): {{ subject }}

{{ body }}

{{ footer }}
```

Where type = { feat | fix | doc | style | refactor | test | chore }
